# Competition Math Reference

A searchable reference for MATHCOUNTS, AMC 10/12, AIME and olympiad training. 556 cards
covering formulas, general techniques, and recurring problem formats, plus a database of
1367 past contest problems cross-linked to the cards their solutions run through.

Fully static and fully offline: no build step, no server, and nothing fetched at runtime. KaTeX
0.16.11 is vendored under `vendor/katex/` (its CSS, its JS, and the twenty woff2 faces the CSS
asks for), so the app renders the same on a plane or behind a network that blocks CDNs. It used to
load KaTeX from jsdelivr, where a block meant every formula in the library showed as raw LaTeX.

## The two books

The sidebar splits into two groups, and only one is open at a time.

**Formulas** holds the reference proper, in four subjects (Geometry, Algebra, Number
Theory, Counting & Probability), each divided into topical subsections that run from
bedrock (Pythagorean Theorem, stars and bars) to deep cuts (Casey's Theorem, Zsygmondy,
the Brocard angle).

**Additional Tools** holds the two things that are not formulas, each filed by subject:

- **Methods** are general techniques, the moves you make once you are already inside a
  problem: angle chasing, casework, coordinate bashing, generating functions.
- **Patterns** are specific recurring problem formats with an intended solution you are
  expected to know on sight: single-pile take-away games, minimising a sum of absolute
  values, cryptarithms.

The test that separates them: a pattern describes a whole problem you can recognise from
its statement, a method describes a move you make inside one. Method and pattern cards
carry a badge and a **Key forms** block listing the shapes the technique takes; formula
cards carry neither, since their formulas are already enumerated on the card face.

## Search

Hybrid retrieval, rebuilt from scratch and measured rather than tuned by eye.

- **Lexical**: BM25F over eight weighted fields (name, keywords, concepts, latex,
  description, section context, glossary, body), with fields combined as *strongest plus a
  fraction of the rest* rather than summed.
- **Phrase matching**: adjacent word pairs indexed with their own document-frequency
  table, including pairs from a spoken rendering of each formula, so "two pi r" finds
  the circumference.
- **Semantic**: static distilled embeddings (256-dim int8, ~17k words, four vectors per
  card), lazily fetched on first search and degrading silently to lexical-only if absent.
- **Fusion**: reciprocal rank fusion, gated on query length, lexical margin and semantic
  confidence, so short exact queries are left alone and paraphrases get help.
- **Spelling correction** resolves an unknown token to its nearest corpus word. Distance is
  optimal string alignment, so a swapped pair of letters ("descrates") costs one edit, not two.

Press `/` to focus the box, `Esc` to clear. A query that starts with `Special:` is a command
instead of a search (see Special pages below).

`tools/search-eval.html` runs 185 labelled queries against the live app and diffs every one
against `tools/eval-baseline.json`. Current: 170/185 top-1, MRR 0.950 (warm run), with the two
probe sets at 64/78 and 48/77.
**Wait for the semantic vectors to load before reading results**, or the run under-reports
by a point or two; compare warm runs to warm runs.

## Other features

- **Level and importance filters** narrow any section to MATHCOUNTS through Olympiad, or
  to the tiers from `high` down to `lowest`.
- **Problem database** (`Database`) lists past contest problems by year and family, each
  linked to the cards its solution uses, with a one-line strategy note.
- **Study lists** (`Lists`) hold 31 curated sets alongside your own. Twelve contest routes
  (tier x subject) plus four olympiad ones are *complete by construction* — every card
  carrying that level and subject is in them, which `tools/check-lists.py` enforces. A list
  you build yourself is grouped into sections automatically, by matching its cards against
  the hand-written section headings already used across the built-in lists.
- **Diagrams** are computed from exact geometry rather than sketched, so every point is a
  true intersection, foot or tangency. Configuration-heavy cards also show their figure on
  the card face, and long write-ups place further figures inside the text, next to the
  paragraph each one illustrates (152 on 130 cards).
- **Connected formulas.** A few broad cards (auxiliary lines, p-adic valuation, the mean chain,
  modular basics and eleven more) end with a hand-picked row of the cards that are part of the
  same idea, above Related: LTE, Legendre and Kummer under p-adic valuation, the construction
  cards under auxiliary lines. Related is computed and means "explore more"; Connected is
  curated and means "these belong to this card". The list is `js/data/connected.js`.
- **Interactive widgets** on selected cards: drag the vertices and watch the invariant hold.
- **Advanced search** builds a query from tag chips across the whole library.
- **Settings** (`#/settings`) cover theme, density, text size, section layout (cards or a
  wiki-style A-Z index), keyword chips, figures on card faces, figure captions on card faces
  (hide them to keep only the picture), and **notation**: in the expanded form, every formula
  box and Key forms bullet that uses a sigma or a product sign shows its terms written out.
- **Special pages**, run from the search box or from Settings → Commands, in the style of
  Wikipedia's: `Special:Random`, `Special:RandomProblem/<contest>`, `Special:RandomStarred`,
  `Special:WhatLinksHere/<card>`, `Special:AllPages` (an A-Z index with a letter bar),
  `Special:LonelyPages`, `Special:Statistics` and `Special:Search/<query>`. Typing `Special:`
  opens a dropdown of the best matches, commands first and then their arguments (a contest, a
  card), which closes when you click away; every special page links back to the command list.
- **Experimental** pages, in `lab/`, opening in their own tab and loading only the data
  files so they cannot destabilise the app: a **Formula Web** that draws every card as a
  node and traces the shortest chain of authored links between any two, a **Quiz** that
  shows a statement and figure and asks you to name it, and **Flashcards**, a spaced-repetition
  review (a small SM-2: Again, Hard, Good, Easy) over any section or list, name to statement,
  statement to name, or both, scheduled separately per direction and kept in this browser.
- Light and dark themes; KaTeX throughout; `copy tex` and `copy asy` on every card.

## Running

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8688
```

then open `http://localhost:8688`. Opening `index.html` directly also works, except that
the semantic search index cannot be fetched from a `file://` page, so search falls back to
lexical-only. KaTeX is vendored, so math renders offline either way.

```

Run every checker before committing (the seven in CONVENTIONS §7); each exits non-zero on a
finding.

A card's write-up, examples and diagram are all keyed by its id in flat maps, so **moving a
card between files only moves the card object**; nothing else needs to follow it.

## Adding a card

```js
{
  id: "unique-kebab-case-id",
  name: "Display Name",
  type: "method",                            // omit for a formula; "method" or "pattern"
  subject: "geometry",                       // required on method/pattern cards
  latex: String.raw`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`,        // String.raw: no backslash-escaping needed
  description: String.raw`Prose; inline math with $...$ works.`,
  keywords: ["search", "terms", "here"],
  importance: "high",                        // high | medium | low | lower | lowest
  level: ["MATHCOUNTS", "AMC10", "AMC12", "AIME", "Olympiad"]   // any subset
}
```

Drop it into the appropriate subsection's `formulas` array and reload; nav counts, search
index and filters pick it up automatically. Multi-formula `latex` separated by `\qquad`
(or `,`/`;` plus `\quad`) is stacked onto separate lines automatically, and
`\begin{cases}` / `\begin{gathered}` work for explicit layout.

The `subject` field matters: topic chips and the symbol-to-concept rules are gated on it,
so a method filed under Additional Tools still resolves against its home subject.

Longer content goes in the id-keyed side files: `## Why it works`, `## How to use it` and
`## On contests` in `js/data/details/`, a `{ q, s }` pair in `examples-supplement.js`. On a
method or pattern card a leading `## Key forms` block is pulled out and rendered under the
description; each bullet may carry an explanation after a ` — `, shown as gray subtext.

If the `latex` uses `\sum` or `\prod`, add a `latexPlain` right after it with the terms written
out ($a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$); a Key forms bullet with a sigma writes both forms as
`\alt{sigma form}{written-out form}`. The notation setting picks one, and `scan-conventions.py`
fails on a sigma with no written-out twin. To give a broad card a Connected formulas row, add it
to `js/data/connected.js` (CONVENTIONS §12).

## Changelog

**2026-09-27**

- Connected formulas: a curated row on 15 broad cards (83 links), drawn in Related's chip
  style, gated by `check-lists.py`.
- Special pages and commands, with a Wikipedia-style dropdown of suggestions under the search
  box; a Commands group in Settings, collapsed behind "Show all commands".
- Flashcards joined the lab. A setting hides figure captions on card faces.
- Expanded notation now covers all 93 cards whose formula uses a sigma or product sign, and the
  Key forms bullets that use one, through `latexPlain` and `\alt{..}{..}`.
- New gate `tools/check-labels.py`: renders every figure in Chrome and fails on a label that
  touches a dot, a line or another label, leaves its canvas, was moved more than 14px by the
  tidy pass, or has an arrowhead running into it.
- Typo tolerance counts a transposition as one edit.
- Cards merged: `digit-sum-mod-9` into `divisibility-rules` (with the $101$, $1001$ extension of
  the rule for $11$), `vp-factorial` into `legendres-formula`, `angle-bisector-reflection` into
  `perp-to-angle-bisector`. Cards added: `linear-change-of-variables` and `polar-coordinates`.
  Card count 556.
- Two write-ups lost to a merge script (`recognition-numbers`, `gcd-substitution`) were restored,
  and `scan-conventions.py` now fails on any card without a write-up (CONVENTIONS §6).
- Cross-links: each card is linked at its first mention on the page, once (212 links moved, 154
  of them into descriptions, which now carry links on the card page), and linking never lowers
  capitals: named results keep them everywhere (417 fixed). Both are gated by
  `scan-conventions.py`.
- Rewritten to the teaching standard: 210 of 556 cards.
